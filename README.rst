Benefits
========

This is a command line tool and Python library to manage and integrate security tokens:

* Issue out new stock series

* Printing out cap table

* Printing out my portfolio

* Managing bad transactions and lost privat keys

* Paying dividends

* Delivering voting ballots

In theory the APIs are backend neutral, but only EVM compatible chains are supported at the moment.
