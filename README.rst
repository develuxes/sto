This is a Python package for technical corporate governance actions in TokenMarket TM-01 security framework.

The Python wrapper API describes actions for

* Issue out new stock series

* Printing out cap table

* Printing out my portfolio

* Reverting transactions

* Paying dividends

* Delivering voting ballots

In theory the APIs are backend neutral, but only EVM compatible chains are supported at the moment.
