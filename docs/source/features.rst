Supported token standards and protocols
---------------------------------------

We currently support

* `TokenMarket SecurityToken <http://github.com/tokenmarketnet/ico>`_

Any ERC-20 like token should work with very little modifications to the tool. We are actively looking to other token models (Polymath) as soon as we establish proper partnerships.

Support for other networks (EOS) is coming as well, as soon as we establish proper partnerships.
