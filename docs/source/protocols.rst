Blockchains and token protocols
===============================

Introduction
------------

Currently, there does not exist a single standard or reference implementation for security tokens. TokenMarket is working in several working groups to come up with one.

Supported token standards and protocols
---------------------------------------

We currently support

* `TokenMarket security token <http://github.com/tokenmarketnet/smart-contracts>`_

* Other ERC-20 token for cap tables, token ownership and such operations (ERC-1400, ERC-1600)

TokenMarket security token
--------------------------

`TokenMarket security token <http://github.com/tokenmarketnet/smart-contracts>`_ is a ERC-20 standard based token for public Ethereum blockchain. We have implemented securities specific features, like real world identification, rolling back bad transfers and dividends payouts.

TokenMarket security token works with any ERC-20 token capable wallet and thus is easy to integrate to the existing blockchain ecosystem.

Future Ethereum protocols
-------------------------

Any ERC-20 like token should work with very little modifications to the tool. We are actively looking to other token models as soon as we establish proper partnerships.

Future blockchains
------------------

TokenMarket is working to establish partnership and roll out security tokens on the following technologies

* EOS (EOS mainnet, Telos, Worbli)

* IBM Hyperledger chains

* R3 Corda chains
