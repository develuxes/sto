Protocols
=========

Supported token standards and protocols
---------------------------------------

This project currently support

* `TokenMarket SecurityToken <http://github.com/tokenmarketnet/ico>`_ for issuance

* Any ERC-20 token for cap tables, token holdership and such operations


Future protocols
----------------

Any ERC-20 like token should work with very little modifications to the tool. We are actively looking to other token models (Polymath) as soon as we establish proper partnerships.

Support for other networks (EOS) is coming as well, as soon as we establish proper partnerships.
